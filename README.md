# Covid-19-Vaccines-Analysis
There was a time when Covid-19 got out of hand. Even after the lockdown, this still resulted in a rapid increase in cases as in some countries cases were brought under control 
but the economy was sacrificed. In such a situation, only vaccines are seen as the only tool that can help the world fight covid-19.

Many vaccines have been introduced so far to fight covid-19. No vaccine has guaranteed 100% accuracy so far, but most manufacturing companies claim their vaccine is not 100% accurate, but still, it will save your life by giving you immunity.

Thus, each country tries to vaccinate a large part of its population so as not to depend on a single vaccine. That’s what I’m going to analyze, which is how many vaccines each country is using to fight covid-19.
